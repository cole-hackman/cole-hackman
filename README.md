<h1 align="center">Hi 👋 I'm Cole Hackman</h1>

# 💫 About Me
I’m a student at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), originally from Seattle, WA and currently based in San Luis Obispo, CA. I’m studying computer science with a concentration in AI and machine learning, and I’m interested in building software that combines technical depth with real-world impact.

I enjoy working on systems that people actually use, from AI-powered tools to full-stack web applications, and I bring a generalist mindset shaped by engineering, entrepreneurship, and business experience. In my free time, I enjoy DJing and mixing, going to the gym, hiking, and thrifting.
